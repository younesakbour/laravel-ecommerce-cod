Hi my friend, this project created by me and my partner it is an Ecommerce website based in cash in delivery.

first of all you need to create mysql database with name "ecom".
second you need to open terminal and run these commands:
1- composer update
2- php artisan migrate
3- php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
Now your done.

for go to the dashboard you need just to open slash like that: /login
email: younesyoussef@gmail.com
password: younesyoussef2023

NOTE: for changing email and password go to file UserSeeder.php in folder database/seeders after change run these commands:
1- php artisan migrate:f
2- php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
If you don't want to make your tables clear all you need to go phpmyadmin and delete the user manualy from table users
and run the command "2-" only.
